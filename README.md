Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, Milvus vector database, and Granite LLM (via Replicate API). The goal is to improve contextual question answering by retrieving relevant information from documents before generating responses.

By combining vector similarity search with large language model generation, this project demonstrates how to build scalable and intelligent AI applications.

📂 Workflow

Setup Environment

Install dependencies via requirements.txt or notebook cells.

Load Data

Downloads the sample dataset (State of the Union speech).

Preprocess & Chunk Documents

Splits text into smaller chunks for efficient retrieval.

Embed & Store in Vector DB

Uses HuggingFace embeddings + Milvus for semantic search.

Retrieve Relevant Chunks

Similarity search to find the most relevant context for a query.

Generate Answer with LLM

Granite LLM (via Replicate) generates a contextual response.

📊 Example

Query:

What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson?


Retrieved Context + Answer:

The president praised Ketanji Brown Jackson’s qualifications and historic nomination to the Supreme Court.

📈 Future Improvements

Add evaluation metrics (precision, recall, semantic similarity)

Extend pipeline for multi-file ingestion (PDF, CSV, etc.)

Improve chunking strategy with overlap for better retrieval

Deploy as a Streamlit/Flask app for interactive use
